This is an attempt to evaluating several State Management approaches in tackling a UI implementation. I hope this will help you in choosing what to go with.

In this repo, I have gone through vanilla approaches, including:

1. InheritedWidget + ChangeNotifier
2. Provider + ChangeNotifier
3. Provider + StateNotifier
4. Riverpod (Coming soon)

You can check them out in different branches above.

## Stream

I personally don't think we will benefits anything from Stream in UI implementation so that State Management using Stream like BLoC/bloc will not be included in this repo.

## Credit

I wanna say thanks to [Stano Bagin](https://dribbble.com/staacopy) and his [design on dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2729372-Paleo-Paddock-ios-application-menu-animation) that this version took an inspiration from it.
